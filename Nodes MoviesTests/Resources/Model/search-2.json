Pulp fiction, named for the low quality paper on which the stories were printed, blossomed in the early twentieth century. After WWI and the Great Depression, audiences sought tales with strong heroes, exciting adventures and alien encounters. This entertaining documentary traces the golden years of pulps, beginning in the 1920's, by highlighting numerous writers including Erle Stanley Gardner and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Popular and prolific authors Ray Bradbury and Frederik Pohl recall the days of nominal pay, short deadlines, and the insatiable demand for copy. Special coverage is given to the original cover art that defined pulp, featuring beautiful women, space creatures and blazing weapons.",
